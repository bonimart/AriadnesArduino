# Ariadne's Arduino

Welcome to an incredible navigation tool, Ariadne's Arduino!
Here, you'll learn how to use the tool.

## Controls

You can control the tool using two buttons (L and R).
L is mostly used as a step-delimiter.
R is used for changing the state of the tool

## Menu

After start-up, you are in the main Menu.
If you wish to start tracking your path, press R, this way you enter the Read state.

## Read

In the Read state your path is being tracked.
After every step, press L, this way the tool will know you made a step.
On the display, you can see the amount steps you've taken so far.

If you have finished your path and wish to be navigated back to your origin, press R, thus entering Navigation state.

## Navigation

In the Navigation state you are being navigated to the origin of your tracked path.

At first, the display tells you how to turn in order to walk correctly.
Once you are facing the right direction, you are prompted "Make a step!". The process of making a step is the same as in the Read state - you need to press L.

The display also shows how many steps left there are.

If you loose your wits in the Navigation state, press R, thus entering Menu.
